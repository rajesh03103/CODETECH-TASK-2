Key Features:

1. Student Information Management: Store and retrieve student details, including name, date of birth, and email address.
2. Course Management: Manage course information, including course name and credits.
3. Enrollment Management: Record student enrollments, grades, and academic terms.
4. Joining Student Data: Combine student information with enrollment data to provide a comprehensive view.
5. GPA Calculation: Automatically calculate students' grade point averages (GPAs) based on grades.
6. Course Retrieval: Retrieve courses taken by individual students.


Database Design:

The system consists of three main tables:


1. Students: Stores student information.
2. Courses: Stores course details.
3. Enrollments: Records student enrollments and grades.


SQL Queries:

The project includes various SQL queries to:


1. Insert data into tables.
2. Retrieve student records.
3. Join student and enrollment data.
4. Calculate GPAs.
5. Retrieve courses taken by students.


Benefits:

1. Efficient student data management.
2. Simplified course and enrollment tracking.
3. Automated GPA calculations.
4. Enhanced data analysis capabilities.


Potential Applications:

1. Educational institutions (schools, colleges, universities).
2. Student information systems.
3. Academic management software.


Future Enhancements:

1. Implement user authentication and authorization.
2. Develop a user interface for data entry and retrieval.
3. Integrate with existing student information systems.
4. Expand functionality to include additional features (e.g., attendance tracking, fee management).
